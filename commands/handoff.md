# /handoff - Create Session Checkpoint

Create an explicit checkpoint of your current work for seamless continuation in a new session.

## When to Use

- End of work session
- Before running a context-heavy operation
- When you want a clean continuation point
- Proactively, before context gets too full

## Process

1. **Gather Current State**
   - Read rolling checkpoint (files, todos, plan, decisions)
   - Check git status for uncommitted work
   - Get current task context

2. **Synthesize Summary**
   - What we were doing
   - Where we left off
   - What's next

3. **Create Handoff**
   Call the MCP tool:
   ```typescript
   create_handoff({
     task: "Brief description of current work",
     summary: "Where we are in the process",
     nextSteps: ["Immediate next action", "Following step"],
     decisions: ["Key decision 1", "Key decision 2"]
   })
   ```

4. **Present to User**
   Display the handoff confirmation and continuation prompt.

## Output Format

Display the handoff confirmation followed by the continuation prompt:

**Handoff Created: {id}**
- Task: {task}
- Files: {count} modified
- Plan: {plan.path} (cached)
- Decisions: {count} captured
- Todos: {count} items ({in_progress} in progress)

**Continuation Prompt** (copy for next session):

```
# Continue: {task}

{summary}

## Context
- Key decision: {decisions[0]}
- Blocked on: {blockers[0] || "Nothing"}

## Next
1. {nextSteps[0]}
2. {nextSteps[1]}

Run /start to load full context.
<!-- session:{id} -->
```

## Integration with Harness

If claude-harness is available, the handoff also:
- Updates `working-context.json`
- Records decisions to episodic memory
- Does NOT commit, push, or run tests (save that for fresh session)

## Tips

- **Be specific** with the task description - it's the headline for recovery
- **Include blockers** if any - helps future Claude understand constraints
- **List concrete next steps** - actionable items for immediate resumption

## Recovery

When starting a new session, paste the continuation prompt. Claude will:
1. Detect the session marker
2. Call `/start` with the handoff ID
3. Load full context from storage
4. Resume work seamlessly
